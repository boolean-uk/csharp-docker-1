# C# Docker Exercise 1

## Learning Objectives  

- Deploy an API to a Docker Container  

## Instructions  

1. Fork this repository  
2. Clone the fork to your machine  
3. Open in Visual Studio  

## Introduction  

In this exercise you will be Dockerizing a simple WebApi.  

## Core 

Create an endpoint with GET/POST/PUT/DELETE for the Book  

Create a `Dockerfile` and any other associated files to allow you to deploy the application using a Docker Container.

Do not share your credentials in the `application.yml` file. 

To assess this we will clone your repository, add our own credentials to the cloned repository and use those to test that the application works as expected.


## Extension

In addition to the Book, create an endpoint for Author with GET/POST/PUT/DELETE 

Create a Publisher model and add as a foreign key relationship to the Book (add a foreignkey/Book property).
